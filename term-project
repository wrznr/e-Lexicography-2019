Project ideas 
=============
(see below for the explanation of A,B,C)

* General: A+B+C1 
* more specific:
* B+C ; replace A) by gutenberg.org/literature or by wikisource (idea make use of diachronic data; compare British Novels to AmE novels...)
* A=German fake-news corpus; B); C1) fake-news dictionary or C2) selected key entries
* software project: creation of a "word sketch" / wortprofil with spacy-tools/nltk...; include NE recognition --> provide word-sketch paper (AG)
* more ideas...

Compontents of the term project
================================

A) Crawling 
	* crawling an interesting and sufficiently large corpus
	* candidates for corpora: cnn, NYT, fake news sites (postillon, allgemeine allgemeine)
	* via sitemap from the website or index of commoncrawl.org (via cdx_toolkit, news-please)
	* Metadata (+title, +date, ?"rubric", ?author) + url

B) Corpus analysis
	* analysing the data:
  * e.g. python nltk,spacy: lemma, pos, colloc, concordances, dependancy parsing

C1) Automatic creation of dictionary content
	* create and populate a dictionary (tei-lex-0 format):
	* form=lemma/orth; gramGrp, cit (colloc+ example sentences)
  * if possible 10.000 entries (for 1 million tok corpus ~5000 is realistic)
  * possible extension: extract definitory contexts (!doesn't work well for highly frequent and polysemous words)

C2) Manual dictionary creation: write manual entries (~5)

Technicalities
==============
Important dates
--------------

* write abstract: march 8th
* term paper:
* type A+B+C project: code + result (corpora, intermediate corpus results + xml-tei-0) + paper of 5-10 pages explaining method chosen
* for the software project: code + software documentation; some test data; report of 5-10 pages explaning the method; 
* submission: April 2nd

Suggested outline of the report
--------------
* Title Page
* Introduction: explain and motivate the goal(s) of the report 
** description of resources and adopted method (+short code description in addition to the software documentation)
** description of results
** Discussion and conclusion
